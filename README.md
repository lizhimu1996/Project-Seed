# Project idea

Our porject is creating a shopping website to small family farm and gardeners, and the main products are various plant seeds. The website can provide the best recommendations about seeds choice and the corresponding planting methods and planning according to customer demand.

# Project background/Business Opportunity

As we all know, Canada, as a large agricultural country, has many related policies to encourage the development of agriculture. For this reason, there are many people who want to build new farms or immigrate through agricultural polcies in this country try to start their own business. At the same time, because of the less stressful living environment, there are also many gardening enthusiasts in the city. And our website can provide customers with a quantity and diverse supply of seeds. Due to the long winters in Canada, the diversity of climatic conditions and soil types, planting will not be easy for new farmers and gardeners, so the our websites also can provide detailed information about all kinds of seeds. Customers can search for their favorite seed types and learn related planting conditions and methods on the website.

All members of our team have experience and skills in making webpages, but in this cooperative project we will make some different attempts, such as adding search functions to webpages.
